# dynos-work: Audit

Runs the full audit-to-done pipeline: audit → repair loop → DONE.

All repair-log persistence must go through `python3 hooks/ctl.py write-repair-log ... --from ...`.
Do not hand-write `.dynos/task-{id}/repair-log.json`.

## Ruthlessness Standard

- Missing evidence is a finding.
- Partial compliance is non-compliance.
- Cosmetic fixes do not count as repairs.
- If a path is unverified, treat it as suspect.
- Prefer surfacing a real risk over preserving a comforting narrative.
- If two interpretations exist, audit the harsher one until disproved.
- Do not let a clean summary hide a dirty edge case.

## What you do

### Step 0 — Contract validation

After finding the active task, validate that all required inputs from the execute skill are present:

```text
python3 hooks/ctl.py validate-contract --skill audit --task-dir .dynos/task-{id}
```

If validation fails with missing required inputs (evidence files, snapshot SHA), print the errors and stop.

### Step 1 — Find active task

Find the most recent active task in `.dynos/`. Read `manifest.json`.

Verify stage is `CHECKPOINT_AUDIT`. If not, print the current stage and what command to run instead.

### Step 2 — Audit Setup

Build the deterministic audit setup first:

```text
python3 hooks/ctl.py run-audit-setup .dynos/task-{id}
```

This command reads `manifest.json`, derives the audit plan, writes `.dynos/task-{id}/audit-plan.json`, and computes diff scope from `snapshot.head_sha` (or `HEAD` fallback when needed). Use its JSON output directly. Do not hand-derive diff scope, task type, domains, fast-track, skip policy, or model selection in prompt logic.

### Step 3 — Audit (conditional auditor spawning with skip optimization)

When spawning auditors, tell them to attack the implementation, not narrate it. Favor findings with proof over summaries with tone.

## Auditor Prompt Discipline (default fallback)

For any auditor that does NOT have a `## Turn Budget Discipline` section in its agent file, the orchestrator applies these defaults when constructing the spawn prompt:

- Final message MUST contain only a JSON code block matching the canonical audit-report schema. No prose, no commentary, no markdown around the JSON.
- Tool-use budget: haiku ≤ 15, sonnet ≤ 20, opus ≤ 25 tool uses.
- When within 3 tool uses of the budget, stop and emit the report.

For each auditor in the plan:
- If `action: "skip"`: log `{timestamp} [SKIP] {name} — {reason}` and do not spawn
- If `action: "spawn"`: spawn with the specified `model` (null = default)
- Log: `{timestamp} [ROUTE] {name} model={model} route={route_mode} source={route_source}`
- For the plan-auditor: For each AC in spec.md naming a function signature, verify plan.md's Component section names the same signature. Mismatch is a partial finding.

**Pre-load diff context (run once, write to sidecar, reference by path):** Using `diff_base` from the audit plan output, write the context ONCE to a sidecar file and reference its path in each auditor's base prompt. Do NOT capture the full content into a shell variable and append it to every prompt — that pattern multiplies (auditors × cascade-models × context-size) input tokens, which is exactly the regression the 2026-04-30 latency investigation flagged in CG-013 (the mislabeled "perf:" commit).

```bash
AUDIT_CONTEXT_PATH=".dynos/task-{id}/audit-context.md"
python3 "${PLUGIN_HOOKS}/build_prompt_context.py" --diff {diff_base} --root . --sidecar "$AUDIT_CONTEXT_PATH"
```

<!-- pre-resolved-context-start -->

<!-- pre-resolved-context-end -->

In each auditor's base prompt, include a single line referencing the sidecar:

```
A pre-computed audit context (unified diff + current contents of changed files) is at `<AUDIT_CONTEXT_PATH>`. Read it ONCE at the start of your work via the Read tool. Do NOT re-read it for each finding, and do NOT call Read/Grep/Glob for files already covered there.
```

Read calls are cheap and parallel (per auditor, per session); prompt input tokens are billed per LLM call and multiply across the haiku→sonnet→opus cascade. The sidecar pattern keeps the per-prompt overhead at ~80 bytes regardless of diff size. If the sidecar file is empty (no changed files found, e.g. on first task or after a clean commit), the auditors proceed without it — the line in their prompt is harmless when the file is absent.

**Learned Auditor Injection (MANDATORY — deterministic via router):** Build each auditor's spawn prompt with `router.py audit-inject-prompt`. Pipe the base prompt over stdin and capture stdout as the prompt you pass to the Agent tool — do NOT read the learned agent file yourself or build the prompt by hand. The router does the frontmatter stripping, applies the learned-auditor block under the literal heading `## Learned Auditor Instructions`, computes the SHA-256 of the exact bytes it prints, and atomically writes the per-model sidecar at `.dynos/task-{id}/receipts/_injected-auditor-prompts/{auditor_name}-{model_used}.sha256` (with a companion `.txt` of the same bytes; when no model is specified the literal `default` is substituted in the filename).

**Parallelism note (task-20260430-011):** This sidecar pre-computation is per-auditor work, NOT a serial constraint between auditors. Issue all `router.py audit-inject-prompt` Bash commands in **a single message with multiple Bash tool calls** — they have no inter-dependencies and complete independently. Then issue the Agent-tool spawns themselves the same way: a single message with multiple Agent tool calls, one per spawned auditor. Sequential pre-step bash calls followed by sequential Agent calls is the slow path the latency investigation flagged; the harness already supports parallel tool calls in a single message and the pre-step has no ordering constraints. Wall-clock cost drops from `sum(per-auditor sidecar + spawn)` to `max(sidecar) + max(spawn)`.

```bash
echo "{base prompt for this auditor}" | PYTHONPATH="${PLUGIN_HOOKS}:${PYTHONPATH:-}" python3 "${PLUGIN_HOOKS}/router.py" audit-inject-prompt \
  --root . \
  --task-type {task_type} \
  --audit-plan .dynos/task-{id}/audit-plan.json \
  --auditor-name {name} \
  --model {model}
```

The command logs `learned_auditor_applied`, `learned_auditor_missing`, or `learned_auditor_error` to `.dynos/events.jsonl` depending on whether the named auditor's `agent_path` exists and could be read. On any IO failure the command exits 1 and prints a JSON error to stderr — fix the cause (audit-plan path, auditor name, or `--task-type`) before retrying.

After each auditor spawn returns, you MUST write the audit receipt via the deterministic ctl wrapper below. Do NOT hand-write a Python `receipt_audit_done(...)` call. The wrapper derives `finding_count` and `blocking_count` from the on-disk report file so the model cannot mix one auditor/model's counts with another auditor/model's report. The captured digest must be the contents of the sidecar file the router just wrote — read it back rather than re-hashing:

```bash
INJECTED_AGENT_SHA256=$(cat .dynos/task-{id}/receipts/_injected-auditor-prompts/{auditor_name}-{model_used}.sha256)
python3 hooks/ctl.py audit-receipt .dynos/task-{id} {auditor_name} \
  --model {model_used} \
  --report-path .dynos/task-{id}/audit-reports/{report_filename}.json \
  --tokens-used {tokens_used} \
  --route-mode {route_mode} \
  --agent-path {agent_path} \
  --injected-agent-sha256 "${INJECTED_AGENT_SHA256}"
```

`python3 hooks/ctl.py audit-receipt ...` calls `receipt_audit_done(...)`, which re-asserts the same sidecar exists at that exact path and that its contents match `injected_agent_sha256`. A mismatch raises `ValueError`. For `route_mode == "generic"` (no learned agent) the sidecar assertion is skipped and `injected_agent_sha256` may be `None`; `route_mode` and `agent_path` are still required keyword arguments. The wrapper derives counts from `--report-path`; when no report exists it writes literal zero findings only. The new `receipt_audit_routing` writer also enforces these fields per-entry, so any auditor entry missing `injected_agent_sha256` (when non-generic) or `agent_path` will hard-fail at the routing-receipt write.

The router handles fast-track reduction, skip policy, model policy, security floor enforcement, ensemble voting triggers, and learned agent routing in deterministic code. No prompt interpretation needed for these decisions. Do not re-derive skip thresholds, model assignments, or routing modes from markdown tables or retrospective files.

**Ensemble Voting:** If the router plan has `"ensemble": true` for an auditor, follow this sequential cascade instead of a single spawn:

1. Spawn **haiku** (first model in `ensemble_voting_models`).
2. If haiku returns **zero findings** → spawn **sonnet** (second model in `ensemble_voting_models`).
   - If sonnet returns **zero findings** → audit passes. Log: `{timestamp} [VOTE] {name} — PASS (haiku then sonnet: zero findings)`
   - If sonnet returns **any findings** → escalate: spawn `ensemble_escalation_model` (opus). Opus verdict is final and binding. Log: `{timestamp} [VOTE] {name} — Escalating to {escalation_model}`
3. If haiku returns **any findings** → skip sonnet entirely, escalate immediately: spawn `ensemble_escalation_model` (opus). Opus verdict is final and binding. Log: `{timestamp} [VOTE] {name} — haiku found issues, escalating directly to {escalation_model}`

If `"ensemble": false`, spawn normally with the single model from the plan.

**Visual Audit Pass:** For tasks where `domains` includes `"ui"`, run a visual audit: start the dev server, use a browser subagent to screenshot modified screens, then evaluate with Claude 3.5 Sonnet against the planning-phase Design Decisions. Report visual findings as category `vision-finding`. Log: `{timestamp} [VISION] UI audit complete -- {N} visual bugs found`.

**Alongside mode deduplication:** When generic and learned auditors both produce findings for the same role, deduplicate by key `{file}:{line}:{category}`. Count duplicates once, preferring the learned version. The deduplicated set feeds into repair and retrospective counts. Track whether learned findings are a superset of generic findings (for promotion decisions by the learn step).

Append to log (transition_task already auto-logged the `[STAGE] → CHECKPOINT_AUDIT` line; only emit the `[SPAWN]` line):
```
{timestamp} [SPAWN] {N} auditors in parallel ({list of names})
```

**Role stamping (MANDATORY — BEFORE each Agent spawn):** Before each auditor's Agent tool invocation, stamp the role file via the deterministic ctl wrapper. The auditor subagent's `pre_tool_use.py` reads `active-segment-role` to resolve role; without this stamp the subagent runs as `execute-inline` and its `audit-reports/` writes are denied by `write_policy`. Issue all stamp-role Bash calls in a single message with multiple Bash tool uses (no inter-dependencies):

```bash
python3 "${PLUGIN_HOOKS}/ctl.py" stamp-role .dynos/task-{id} --role "audit-{name-without-suffix}"
```

The role string strips the `-auditor` suffix from the agent file name: `spec-completion-auditor` → `audit-spec-completion`, `security-auditor` → `audit-security`, `claude-md-auditor` → `audit-claude-md`. The wrapper validates against an allowlist (`hooks/ctl.py::_STAMP_ROLE_ALLOWLIST`) and fails with exit 1 if the resolved string is unknown — a fail-fast guard that catches typos before the spawn.

When auditors run in parallel, the role file is overwritten on each stamp; this is fine because each subagent reads the file at its own first tool call within its own session. The post-spawn cleanup (delete `active-segment-role`) happens after the entire audit batch, not per auditor.

Spawn the determined auditors simultaneously, passing the resolved model for each auditor in the subagent spawn configuration. For alongside-mode auditors, this means two spawns for that role (generic + learned), both counted in {N}.

Each auditor writes its own report to `.dynos/task-{id}/audit-reports/{auditor}-checkpoint-{timestamp}.json`. Every auditor agent has a write capability sufficient for this: auditors with `Bash` use a heredoc; `spec-completion-auditor` has the `Write` tool scoped via `write_policy.py` to its own report path. The role file stamped above is what unlocks the `audit-reports/` write rule for these subagents.

**The orchestrator MUST NOT materialize audit-report files.** Direct `Write`/`Edit`/Bash redirection from the orchestrator (role=`execute-inline`) to `audit-reports/` is denied by `write_policy.decide_write` because the role is not `audit-*`. The orchestrator also cannot self-elevate by stamping the role file directly — `active-segment-role` is wrapper-required (`ctl stamp-role`) and only this skill's prose tells it what to stamp. The only legitimate path for an audit-report file to land on disk is the auditor subagent's own write call. If the auditor returns text instead of writing the file, treat the audit as **failed for this auditor** and re-spawn — do NOT backfill from the auditor's text response. Backfilling is the exact mechanism behind the 2026-04-30 audit-chain forgery incident: 7 of 8 ensemble auditors were synthesized by the orchestrator after one truncation, and the receipt chain validated as clean because there was no harness-level cross-check. The Agent-tool spawn-log hook (`hooks/agent-spawn-log`) now provides that cross-check; the absence of a matching `agent_spawn_post` entry for an auditor whose report is on disk is a hard fail at receipt time (`receipt_audit_done`).

**Token & event capture (applies to all events in Steps 3-5):** After each subagent spawn AND each deterministic check, record the event:

**For LLM subagent spawns** (auditors, repair executors):
```bash
PYTHONPATH="${PLUGIN_HOOKS}:${PYTHONPATH:-}" python3 "${PLUGIN_HOOKS}/lib_tokens.py" record \
  --task-dir .dynos/task-{id} \
  --agent "{agent_name}" \
  --model "{model_name}" \
  --input-tokens {input_tokens} \
  --output-tokens {output_tokens} \
  --phase audit \
  --stage "AUDITING" \
  --type spawn \
  --detail "{what the agent did}"
```

**For deterministic steps** (router decisions, retrospective computation, repair-log validation):
```bash
PYTHONPATH="${PLUGIN_HOOKS}:${PYTHONPATH:-}" python3 "${PLUGIN_HOOKS}/lib_tokens.py" record \
  --task-dir .dynos/task-{id} \
  --agent "{tool_name}" \
  --model "none" \
  --input-tokens 0 \
  --output-tokens 0 \
  --phase audit \
  --stage "AUDITING" \
  --type deterministic \
  --detail "{result summary}"
```

**For repair executor spawns**, use `--phase repair` and include `--segment {segment-id}` if the repair targets a specific segment.

Run this after EVERY event. The hook writes to `.dynos/task-{id}/token-usage.json` with a chronological event log plus aggregated totals. The retrospective's token fields are populated from this file.

**Specific events to record in this skill:**
- Step 3: router audit-plan (type=deterministic, detail="Router decided: spawn X, skip Y")
- Step 3: Each auditor spawn (type=spawn, phase=audit)
- Step 4: repair-log build (type=deterministic, phase=repair)
- Step 4: Each repair executor spawn (type=spawn, phase=repair, include --segment)
- Step 4: ctl check-ownership after repair (type=deterministic, phase=repair)
- Step 4: Re-audit spawns (type=spawn, phase=audit, detail="Re-audit after repair cycle N")
- Step 5: compute_reward / validate_retrospective_scores (type=deterministic, phase=audit, detail="Computed retrospective scores")

**Audit repair gate (deterministic):**

Decide whether audit proceeds to repair or reflect through ctl:

```bash
python3 "${PLUGIN_HOOKS}/ctl.py" run-audit-findings-gate .dynos/task-{id}
```

Use the JSON output as authoritative:
- `status == "repair_required"`: proceed to Step 4
- `status == "clear"`: skip Step 4 and proceed to Step 5

Do NOT re-count blocking findings, infer critical spec failure, or decide repair-vs-reflect from prompt logic.

### Step 4 — Deterministic repair loop

This step runs only when blocking findings exist.

**If `run-audit-findings-gate` returns `status == "clear"`:** skip this step entirely. Proceed to Step 5.

Build the repair queue through ctl:

```bash
python3 "${PLUGIN_HOOKS}/ctl.py" run-audit-repair-cycle-plan .dynos/task-{id}
```

Use this JSON output as authoritative:
- `phase` is the current repair-cycle label (`phase_1`, `phase_2`, or `repair_cycle_N`)
- `repair_cycle` is the exact cycle number the coordinator must write to `repair-log.json`
- `blocking_findings` is the exact finding set to repair now
- each finding's `retry_count` is authoritative
- each finding's optional `model_override` is authoritative
- `critical_spec_finding_ids` must be repaired first
- `transitioned_to_repair_planning == true` means ctl already advanced `CHECKPOINT_AUDIT|FINAL_AUDIT -> REPAIR_PLANNING`

Do NOT collect early findings, late findings, queued findings, or increment retry counts in prompt logic.

Append to log:
```
{timestamp} [REPAIR] {phase} cycle={repair_cycle} findings={list of finding IDs}
```

Build the repair log through ctl — Q-learning assignments are computed inside this command from `repair-cycle-plan.json`; do NOT construct or pipe a separate findings payload:

```text
python3 "${PLUGIN_HOOKS}/ctl.py" run-repair-log-build .dynos/task-{id}
```

This command reads `repair-cycle-plan.json`, calls Q-learning itself, derives `files_to_modify`, writes `.dynos/task-{id}/repair-log.json`, and validates the result. Do NOT ask an LLM to draft `repair-log.json`.

Wait for completion, then finalize repair execution readiness through the control plane:

```text
python3 "${PLUGIN_HOOKS}/ctl.py" run-repair-execution-ready .dynos/task-{id}
```

This command validates `repair-log.json` and advances `REPAIR_PLANNING -> REPAIR_EXECUTION`. Use its JSON output directly.

Build the repair execution groups through ctl:

```text
python3 "${PLUGIN_HOOKS}/ctl.py" run-repair-batch-plan .dynos/task-{id}
```

Use this JSON output as authoritative:
- `execution_groups` is the exact execution order
- groups with `parallel == true` may be spawned concurrently
- groups with `parallel == false` must be serialized
- `model_overrides` inside each batch are authoritative

Do NOT infer parallelism, shared-file conflicts, or execution order from prompt logic.

For each batch, spawn executor agents as assigned in `repair-log.json`:
- `ui-executor`, `backend-executor`, `ml-executor`, `db-executor`, `refactor-executor`, `testing-executor`, `integration-executor`

**Model escalation:** Use the `model_override` values returned by `run-repair-batch-plan` / `repair-log.json`. Do NOT recompute escalation from prose rules.

Each executor receives: the specific finding, the file(s) to fix, and the relevant acceptance criteria text from `spec.md`.

After all batches complete, append to log:
```
{timestamp} [DONE] repair-execution-{phase} — all fixes applied
```

**Phase 1 re-audit (domain-aware, incremental scope):** Build the re-audit plan through ctl:

```bash
python3 "${PLUGIN_HOOKS}/ctl.py" run-audit-reaudit-plan .dynos/task-{id}
```

Use its JSON output as authoritative:
- `modified_files` is the scoped re-audit file set
- `auditors_to_spawn` is the exact auditor list
- `full_scope_auditors` always receive the original broad scope
- `scoped_auditors` receive only `modified_files`

Do NOT hand-compute repair-modified files or choose the re-audit auditor set in prompt logic.

After re-audit, run `run-audit-findings-gate` again.

Update Q-learning outcomes through ctl:

```text
python3 "${PLUGIN_HOOKS}/ctl.py" run-repair-q-update .dynos/task-{id}
```

This command derives outcomes from `repair-log.json` plus the current blocking audit findings and updates the Q-tables deterministically. Do NOT build `outcomes` JSON by hand.

- If `status == "clear"`: proceed to Step 5.
- If `status == "repair_required"`: let the control plane decide whether another repair cycle is legal:

  ```text
  python3 "${PLUGIN_HOOKS}/ctl.py" run-repair-retry .dynos/task-{id}
  ```

  Interpret the JSON result:
  - `status == "repair_retry_ready"`: another repair cycle is allowed. Re-run `run-audit-repair-cycle-plan` and continue with the returned queue.
  - `status == "escalation_required"`: the retry cap blocked another loop. Write `.dynos/task-{id}/escalation.md`, transition to `FAILED`, and stop.

### Step 5 — Gate to DONE

Write the deterministic audit summary:

```bash
python3 "${PLUGIN_HOOKS}/ctl.py" run-audit-summary .dynos/task-{id}
```

This command writes `audit-summary.json` from the on-disk audit reports. Do not aggregate counts by hand.

**Reflect (deterministic reward computation):**

Generate the retrospective through the control plane:

```text
python3 hooks/ctl.py run-audit-reflect .dynos/task-{id}
```

This command computes `task-retrospective.json` and writes the `retrospective` receipt deterministically. Use its JSON output directly.

The written retrospective is complete. Do NOT reopen it to patch `model_used_by_agent`, `agent_source`, `alongside_overlap`, `auditor_zero_finding_streaks`, or `executor_zero_repair_streak` from prompt logic.

**agent_source cross-check:** Retrospective claims of `agent_source[role] = "learned:X"` are cross-checked by `memory/policy_engine.py::_extract_quads` against `.dynos/events.jsonl`. Claims without a matching `learned_agent_applied` event (same `task_id`, same `agent_name`, same `segment_id` — or `segment_id` matching `role.removeprefix("audit-")` for auditor roles) are reclassified to `"generic"` and an `agent_source_reclassified` event is emitted. Auditors must continue to populate `agent_source` honestly — the cross-check is verification, not a substitute for honest reporting. Retrospectives are still accepted when unmatched; only the EMA attribution is downgraded, and the `agent_source_reclassified` events are the audit trail a reviewer can use to spot systemic drift.

Append to log:
```
{timestamp} [DONE] reflect — task-retrospective.json written
```

**Deterministic Postmortem (Step 5a):** Generate the deterministic postmortem report before the LLM analysis so the LLM has access to anomaly detection, recurring patterns, and similar task comparisons.

```bash
PYTHONPATH="${PLUGIN_HOOKS}:${PYTHONPATH:-}" python3 "${PLUGIN_HOOKS}/postmortem.py" generate --root . --task-id {task-id}
```

`memory/postmortem.py:generate_postmortem` (called by `postmortem.py generate`) now writes its own receipt internally as part of the same call. You do NOT need to write a receipt from this skill:

- On successful generation it calls `receipt_postmortem_generated(task_dir, postmortem_json_path)`; the writer itself opens the JSON, counts anomalies / recurring_patterns, and hashes both the JSON and its sibling markdown (task-007 B-001 self-compute contract). Writes `.dynos/task-{id}/receipts/postmortem-generated.json`.
- When the deterministic engine determines there is literally nothing to learn, it short-circuits the postmortem write and instead emits `receipt_postmortem_skipped(task_dir, reason, retrospective_sha256, subsumed_by)` with `reason` from the enum `{"clean-task", "no-findings"}` and `subsumed_by` as a required list argument. The decision is deterministic: (a) `reason="clean-task"`, `subsumed_by=[]` when ≥2 auditors ran AND every auditor reported `findings: []`; (b) `reason="no-findings"`, `subsumed_by=[]` when exactly 1 auditor ran AND it reported `findings: []`; (c) in every other case — any auditor reporting ≥1 finding — the engine does NOT skip; it runs the LLM postmortem and writes `receipt_postmortem_generated` instead. There is no skip path for high-quality repairs: any task with findings must run the full LLM postmortem. The `task-retrospective.json` is hashed at receipt-emission time.
- A receipt-write failure is logged as `postmortem_receipt_failed` / `postmortem_skip_receipt_failed` and does NOT corrupt the postmortem files themselves; the script returns its normal result so the audit pipeline keeps moving.

This writes `postmortems/{task-id}.json` and `postmortems/{task-id}.md` to the persistent project directory. Append to log:
```
{timestamp} [DONE] postmortem — anomalies={N}, recurring_patterns={N}
```

**LLM Postmortem Analysis (Step 5b):** After the deterministic postmortem, run LLM-powered failure analysis. This step is skipped for clean tasks (no findings, no repairs, quality >= 0.8).

1. Build the analysis prompt:
```bash
PYTHONPATH="${PLUGIN_HOOKS}:${PYTHONPATH:-}" python3 "${PLUGIN_HOOKS}/postmortem_analysis.py" build-prompt .dynos/task-{id}
```

2. If the result has `"has_findings": true`, spawn an **opus** agent with the prompt from the `"prompt"` field. Instruct the agent to respond with ONLY the JSON object described in the prompt — no markdown, no explanation.

3. Parse the agent's JSON response and apply it:
```bash
echo '${AGENT_JSON_OUTPUT}' | PYTHONPATH="${PLUGIN_HOOKS}:${PYTHONPATH:-}" python3 "${PLUGIN_HOOKS}/postmortem_analysis.py" apply .dynos/task-{id}
```

This writes `postmortem-analysis.json` to the task dir and merges new prevention rules into `prevention-rules.json`. These rules are automatically included in `project_rules.md` by the policy engine on the next task.

`memory/postmortem_analysis.py:apply_analysis` (called by `postmortem_analysis.py apply`) emits its own receipt internally — do NOT write one from this skill:

- When the agent JSON is empty or non-dict (the orchestrator passed nothing to apply), it emits `receipt_postmortem_skipped(task_dir, "no-findings", retrospective_sha256, subsumed_by=[])`.
- When the sanitized analysis yields zero usable rules, it emits `receipt_postmortem_analysis` internally, passing `analysis_path` and `rules_path` as keyword file-path arguments; hashes are derived from the on-disk files — no caller-supplied hashes are accepted. The receipt records `rules_added=0` and the current on-disk hash of `prevention-rules.json` (or 64 zeros when the file does not exist).
- When the merge appends rules, the same receipt is emitted AFTER the fcntl lock is released so the recorded hash captures the on-disk state visible to other readers. Do not call `receipt_postmortem_analysis` directly from this skill — it is emitted internally by `postmortem_analysis.py apply`.

Append to log:
```
{timestamp} [DONE] postmortem-analysis — {N} prevention rules added
```

If `has_findings` is false, skip this step and append:
```
{timestamp} [SKIP] postmortem-analysis — clean task, nothing to analyze
```

**Post-completion processing:** Improve, policy engine, dashboard, and registry refresh are handled automatically by the `task-completed` hook via the event bus. Do not run them inline. The hook fires after this skill completes and the task reaches DONE.

Finalize completion through ctl:

```text
python3 "${PLUGIN_HOOKS}/ctl.py" run-audit-finish .dynos/task-{id}
```

This command writes `completion.json` and advances `CHECKPOINT_AUDIT|FINAL_AUDIT -> DONE` deterministically. Do NOT call `transition_task(...)` directly from prompt logic.

Print (listing only auditors that were actually spawned, not skipped):
```
Audit complete — ALL PASSED

  {auditor-name}:  PASS
  ... (one line per spawned auditor)

Task complete. Snapshot branch dynos/task-{id}-snapshot can be deleted if desired.
```

---

## Standalone use (no active task)

If no active task is found, run the 5 universal auditors on `git diff --name-only HEAD`. Skip Step 5 (no DONE state to write). Print results and stop.
