# dynos-work: Execute Skill

Manages the parallel execution of the implementation plan via the execution graph. Handles dependency ordering, executor spawning, and final integration.

## Command Funnel (applies to every command in this skill)

Every deterministic step below runs through the plugin CLI. Resolve it once at the start of the skill and substitute the ABSOLUTE path literally into each command you run (permission prefix-matching operates on literal command text):

```bash
PLUGIN_ROOT="${CODEX_PLUGIN_ROOT:-${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-}}"
if [ -z "$PLUGIN_ROOT" ]; then
  echo "Set CODEX_PLUGIN_ROOT or CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT to the dynos-work plugin root." >&2
  exit 2
fi
DYNOS="${PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/dynos"   # resolve once; use the absolute path in every command
```

`"$DYNOS" ctl <subcommand>` wraps `hooks/ctl.py`; `"$DYNOS" hook <script> ...` wraps helper scripts (router, lib_tokens, build_prompt_context, ...) with PYTHONPATH handled internally. A permissions-ON user can allow the single `<plugin-root>/bin/dynos` prefix once instead of approving every call.

JSON payloads (classification, execution-graph, repair-log) are piped to the ctl wrapper over stdin with `--from -` and a heredoc — NEVER staged at `/tmp` or any raw filesystem path (the write policy denies those, by design). Temp files, when genuinely needed, belong in `.dynos/task-{id}/_scratch/`.

## Ruthlessness Standard

- No silent shortcuts.
- No executor prompt may omit learned rules or prevention rules when they exist.
- A segment is not done because code was written; it is done when the required behavior is proven.
- If verification is weak, the segment is weak.
- If a segment can pass with shallow evidence, the prompt is too soft.
- No executor gets to hide behind “close enough.”

## What you do

### Step 0 — Contract validation

Validate that all required inputs from the start skill are present:

```text
"$DYNOS" ctl validate-contract --skill execute --task-dir .dynos/task-{id}
```

If validation fails with missing required inputs, print the errors and stop. Do not proceed with execution.

### Step 1 — Review the Plan

Read `spec.md`, `plan.md`, and `execution-graph.json`. Ensure you understand the dependency chain.

### Step 2 — Snapshot the Base

Before any modification starts:
1. Create a temporary git branch and return to the working branch:
   ```
   git checkout -b dynos/task-{id}-snapshot && git checkout -
   ```
2. Record the snapshot SHA into manifest.snapshot via the audited ctl wrapper:
   ```
   "$DYNOS" ctl record-snapshot .dynos/task-{id}
   ```
   The command auto-detects HEAD SHA and branch from git. It accepts optional
   `--head-sha SHA` and `--branch NAME` to override. Stage gate refuses anything
   at or beyond `EXECUTION`. Re-run with the same SHA is a no-op
   (`status: already_recorded`); a different SHA is refused.

Read the printed JSON for `head_sha` and `branch`. Append to log:
```
{timestamp} [DECISION] snapshot recorded — branch {branch} at {head_sha}
```

### Step 3 — Execute segments (Optimized Scheduler)

Run deterministic execute setup first:

```text
"$DYNOS" ctl run-execute-setup .dynos/task-{id}
```

This command runs execution preflight validation, advances `PRE_EXECUTION_SNAPSHOT -> EXECUTION`, builds the executor plan, and writes the `executor-routing` receipt. Use its JSON output directly.

**Inline vs spawn decision (authoritative):**

The inline branch is permitted ONLY when every cell in row 1 of the table below is satisfied. Any deviation forces the spawn path. Read the executor plan router output first, then look up the row that matches `manifest.fast_track`, the number of segments in `execution-graph.json`, and the segment's `route_mode` + `agent_path` from the router's response.

| fast_track | n_segments | route_mode | agent_path | path_taken |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| true | 1 | generic | null | inline (no subagent spawn) |
| true | 1 | replace | any non-null | spawn (inline FORBIDDEN) |
| true | 1 | alongside | any non-null | spawn (inline FORBIDDEN) |
| false OR n_segments > 1 | any | any | any | spawn |

If any segment has route_mode in {replace, alongside} with non-null agent_path, the inline branch is FORBIDDEN — take the spawn path.

**Inline execution procedure (only when the decision table row says `inline`):** Inline execution skips the executor subagent entirely and runs the segment in this thread. This avoids the ~30K token overhead of agent context setup, but it does NOT relax any other rule. Even in the inline branch, you MUST still run the router, write the executor-routing receipt, and apply the prompt-injection/prevention pipeline to your own work:

1. Run the executor plan router: `"$DYNOS" hook router executor-plan --root . --task-type {task_type} --graph .dynos/task-{id}/execution-graph.json`
2. Write the executor-routing receipt (required for stage transitions).
3. Re-verify the decision table row. If the router's response contains any segment with `route_mode` in `{"replace", "alongside"}` with a non-null `agent_path`, STOP — the inline branch is FORBIDDEN for this task. Fall through to the spawn path below.
4. Run `inject-prompt` with your base prompt to get the complete prompt with prevention rules. Apply those rules to your own work.
5. Log the routing decision: `{timestamp} [ROUTE] {executor} model={model} route={route_mode} source={route_source}`
6. **Transition the manifest stage `PRE_EXECUTION_SNAPSHOT → EXECUTION`** (mandatory — without this the Step 4 transition to `TEST_EXECUTION` is illegal per `ALLOWED_STAGE_TRANSITIONS`). `transition_task` auto-appends the `[STAGE] → EXECUTION` log line; do not write it manually:

```text
"$DYNOS" ctl transition .dynos/task-{id} EXECUTION
```

Then read the segment, extract the criteria from `spec.md`, make the code changes yourself, write evidence, and proceed to Step 4. Log: `{timestamp} [INLINE] seg-1 — fast-track inline execution (no subagent spawn)`.

Inline execution does not relax standards. It removes spawn overhead, not rigor.

Skipping the router in inline mode silently ignores learned agents and breaks the self-learning feedback loop.

**Normal execution (fast_track is false or >1 segment):**

`run-execute-setup` already performed deterministic preflight validation and stage advancement. If it failed, repair the plan first; do not patch around a broken plan during execution.

Immediately compute the authoritative execution schedule:

```bash
"$DYNOS" ctl run-execution-batch-plan .dynos/task-{id}
```

This command is authoritative for:
- segment state: `completed | cached | pending`
- cache eligibility and cache rejection reasons
- dependency depth / critical path
- next runnable batch and remaining batches

Do NOT re-derive dependency depth, cache reuse, or runnable batches in prompt logic. Consume the JSON output and follow it.

If `cached_segments` is non-empty, treat those segments as already satisfied and reuse their evidence files. Append to log: `{timestamp} [CACHE] {segment-id} — skipping (inputs unchanged)`.

If `next_batch` is empty while `pending_segments` is non-empty, stop and fail the task as blocked. That means dependency resolution or receipt state is inconsistent; do not guess.

Progressive auditing remains allowed, but only after a segment is deterministically known complete or cached.

**Deterministic routing (MANDATORY):** Use the `segments` payload returned by `run-execute-setup` as the authoritative executor plan. Do not rebuild routing in prompt logic. The `executor-routing` receipt has already been written.

Do NOT read project_rules.md tables manually. The router handles model policy, agent routing, and security floors deterministically.

**Learned Agent Injection (MANDATORY — NOT OPTIONAL):** For every segment, you MUST build the executor prompt using the deterministic prompt builder. This is not a suggestion. This is an enforcement gate. For each segment in the executor plan:

```bash
echo "{your base prompt for this segment}" | "$DYNOS" hook router inject-prompt --root . --task-type {task_type} --graph .dynos/task-{id}/execution-graph.json --segment-id {seg-id}
```

This command:
1. Reads the base prompt from stdin
2. Looks up the routing decision for this segment (model, route_mode, agent_path)
3. If `route_mode` is `replace` or `alongside`, reads the learned agent `.md` file and appends its rules to the prompt
4. Appends prevention rules from the project's history
5. Logs a `learned_agent_applied` event to `.dynos/events.jsonl`
6. Prints the complete prompt to stdout

**Routing cache (automatic — no extra steps):** `executor-plan` writes its result to `.dynos/task-{id}/router-cache/executor-plan.json` keyed by a fingerprint over every input that drives the plan (graph, policy, effectiveness scores, retrospectives, learned registry, benchmark history, prevention rules). Each `inject-prompt` call checks this cache first; on a fingerprint match it reuses the cached entry instead of re-deriving routing. This guarantees the model the executor was spawned under matches the model the prompt was injected for, even with epsilon-greedy exploration enabled. Cache lookups emit a `router_cache_lookup` event with `status: hit | fingerprint_drift | stale_segment`. Inspect freshness with:

```bash
"$DYNOS" hook router router-cache-status --root . --task-type {task_type} --graph .dynos/task-{id}/execution-graph.json
```

If status is `stale`, re-run `executor-plan` before continuing inject-prompt calls — otherwise per-segment routing will silently fall back to live builds.

**Use the OUTPUT of this command as the prompt for the Agent tool spawn.** Do NOT construct the executor prompt yourself. Do NOT skip this step. If you spawn an executor without running inject-prompt first, the learned agent is silently ignored and the whole self-learning system is broken.

**Per-spawn tool budget (since 2026-05-06):** The injected prompt now includes a `## Tool-Use Budget` block specifying the per-spawn tool-call budget computed deterministically from the segment's `files_expected` count and the resolved model (via `hooks/lib_tool_budget.py::compute_segment_budget`). The executor agent self-paces against that value. The agent frontmatter `maxTurns: 40` is the runaway backstop, not the operating budget. Operators should expect executor self-pacing to track segment scope, not the model tier.

**Sidecar capture (MANDATORY).** `cmd_inject_prompt` writes the SHA-256 of the exact bytes it printed to stdout to `.dynos/task-{id}/receipts/_injected-prompts/{seg-id}.sha256` (single-line lowercase hex digest, no trailing newline) plus a companion `.txt` of the same bytes. Both files are written atomically via tempfile + `os.replace`, so a retry overwrites cleanly. Immediately after `inject-prompt` returns, read the sidecar:

```bash
INJECTED_PROMPT_SHA256=$(cat .dynos/task-{id}/receipts/_injected-prompts/{seg-id}.sha256)
```

You MUST pass this captured digest to `receipt_executor_done(...)` below as `injected_prompt_sha256`. The receipt writer asserts the same sidecar exists and matches; a mismatch raises `ValueError` with the literal substrings `injected_prompt_sha256 sidecar missing` or `injected_prompt_sha256 mismatch`.

If the injected prompt is weak, strengthen the base prompt before spawning. Do not accept vague executor instructions.

If `inject-prompt` fails or is unavailable, stop and fix the deterministic routing path. Do NOT manually read `agent_path` or hand-build the learned-agent prompt.

**Role granting (MANDATORY — BEFORE every Agent tool spawn):** Grant the executor role via the deterministic ctl wrapper immediately before spawning each executor subagent. The wrapper enforces the role allowlist; the grant is single-use and is consumed by the spawned subagent's first tool call (the orchestrator's own session is pinned at SessionStart and can never consume a grant — that closes the role-leak behind the 2026-04-30 audit-chain forgery incident; the audit-* forgery defense itself is the spawn-log cross-check at receipt time). Direct writes to `active-segment-role`, `role-grants.json`, or `role-bindings.json` are denied by `write_policy.py` and surface a wrapper hint.

```bash
"$DYNOS" ctl stamp-role .dynos/task-{id} --role "{executor-role}"
```

Where `{executor-role}` is the exact role string from the executor plan (e.g. `backend-executor`, `ui-executor`, `integration-executor`). The write MUST complete (exit 0) before the Agent tool invocation that spawns the subagent — this is a sequential constraint, not a timing one. Exit 1 means the wrapper refused; the stderr names the cause (audit-* refusal, role outside allowlist, missing task dir).

**Model selection:** Pass the `model` field from the executor plan as the model parameter when spawning the agent. If `model` is null, use default (omit the model parameter).

**TDD-First Awareness:** Check if `.dynos/task-{id}/evidence/tdd-tests.md` exists. If it does, include this instruction in the base prompt (before piping through inject-prompt): "A TDD test suite has already been committed. Your implementation must make those tests pass. Do NOT write new tests or modify existing test files."

**Spawn budget check (MANDATORY — BEFORE every batch):**

Before issuing each parallel next_batch executor batch (this includes the first batch AND every subsequent next_batch — the check runs once per spawn cycle, before EACH batch, not only the first), run:

```bash
"$DYNOS" ctl check-spawn-budget .dynos/task-{id}
```

Parse the JSON output. The command emits a single-line JSON object with keys `status`, `count`, `threshold`, `exempt_count`, and `task_class`. If `status` is `'paused'` or `'already_paused'`:

1. Write `escalation.md` in the task directory containing the full JSON output and a human-readable explanation that the spawn budget was exceeded — name the executor count, the threshold, the `task_class`, and instruct the operator to run `"$DYNOS" ctl spawn-resume .dynos/task-{id} --reason "<≥20-char rationale>"` after diagnosing why spawns were wasted.
2. Append a line beginning with `[BUDGET-PAUSE]` to `execution-log.md` that records the timestamp, count, and threshold.
3. Exit non-zero.

Do not proceed with spawning executors. The pause is intentional — the policy is calibrated from this project's retrospective history, and the wasted-spawn count has crossed the learned threshold.

Spawn the `next_batch` executor agents in parallel.

Executor agents by type:
- `ui-executor`, `backend-executor`, `ml-executor`, `db-executor`, `refactor-executor`, `testing-executor`, `integration-executor`, `docs-executor`.

The base prompt for each executor (before inject-prompt) must include:
1. Its specific segment object from `execution-graph.json`
2. The full text of each acceptance criterion referenced by the segment's `criteria_ids` field, extracted from `spec.md`
3. Evidence files from dependency segments: for each segment ID in the executor's `depends_on` list, read `.dynos/task-{id}/evidence/{dependency-segment-id}.md` and include its contents
4. Instruction to write evidence to `.dynos/task-{id}/evidence/{segment-id}.md`
5. **Pre-loaded file contents (MANDATORY):** Run the context builder for each file in the segment's `files_expected` and append its output to the base prompt:

```bash
"$DYNOS" hook build_prompt_context --root . {files_expected_1} {files_expected_2} ...
```

Append the printed output verbatim to the base prompt. This gives the executor the current file contents upfront so it does not need to call Read at the start, keeping the context window small. If a file does not exist yet (new file), the script emits a placeholder — include it anyway so the executor knows the file is new.

Do NOT pass the full `spec.md` or `plan.md` to executors.

**Segment finalization (MANDATORY):** After each executor completes, finalize the segment through ctl instead of hand-writing receipt / ownership / manifest logic:

```bash
"$DYNOS" ctl run-execution-segment-done \
  .dynos/task-{id} \
  "{seg-id}" \
  --injected-prompt-sha256 "{INJECTED_PROMPT_SHA256 captured from sidecar}" \
  --model "{model from plan or null}" \
  --agent-name "{agent_name from plan or None}" \
  --executor-type "{executor from plan}" \
  --evidence-path ".dynos/task-{id}/evidence/{seg-id}.md" \
  --tokens-used {total_tokens from Agent result or None}
```

This command deterministically:
- verifies segment ownership against `execution-graph.json`
- verifies the evidence file exists
- writes `receipt_executor_done(...)`
- updates `manifest.json.execution_progress` from deterministic execution state

**Role cleanup (MANDATORY — AFTER `run-execution-segment-done` writes the receipt):** Clear unconsumed role grants immediately after the segment receipt is written. This prevents a stale grant from leaking into any subsequent segment's spawn. Do NOT `rm` the role file by hand — `active-segment-role` is wrapper-required and the deletion is denied by write_policy; `clear-role` is the sanctioned (privilege-reducing) path:

```bash
"$DYNOS" ctl clear-role .dynos/task-{id}
```

After each batch (or cached resolution) completes, record events and verify:

- **Token capture (executor spawn):** automatic. The `SubagentStop` hook
  (wired in `hooks.json`) parses the subagent's transcript and writes the
  spawn record to the active task's `token-usage.json` via
  `hooks/lib_tokens_hook.py`. Do NOT also emit a manual `--type spawn`
  `lib_tokens.py record` call here — it would double-count the tokens.
  (The `--type deterministic` records below are NOT covered by SubagentStop
  and remain the orchestrator's responsibility.)
- **Token capture (deterministic checks):** After file ownership and evidence verification:
  ```bash
  "$DYNOS" hook lib_tokens record \
    --task-dir .dynos/task-{id} \
    --agent "ctl-check-ownership" \
    --model "none" \
    --input-tokens 0 \
    --output-tokens 0 \
    --phase execution \
    --stage "EXECUTION" \
    --type deterministic \
    --segment "{segment-id}" \
    --detail "Verified file ownership and evidence — {pass|fail}"
  ```
- Also record the **router decision** before each batch:
  ```bash
  "$DYNOS" hook lib_tokens record \
    --task-dir .dynos/task-{id} \
    --agent "router-executor-plan" \
    --model "none" \
    --input-tokens 0 \
    --output-tokens 0 \
    --phase execution \
    --stage "EXECUTION" \
    --type deterministic \
    --detail "Router: {executor}={model} route={route_mode}"
  ```
- Use `run-execution-segment-done` as the authoritative completion gate.
- Append to log: `{timestamp} [DONE] {segment-id} — complete`.
- Re-run `run-execution-batch-plan` to get the next authoritative batch.

**For inline fast-track execution** (no subagent spawn), record with `--type inline`:
```bash
"$DYNOS" hook lib_tokens record \
  --task-dir .dynos/task-{id} \
  --agent "inline-executor" \
  --model "none" \
  --input-tokens 0 \
  --output-tokens 0 \
  --phase execution \
  --stage "EXECUTION" \
  --type inline \
  --segment "seg-1" \
  --detail "Fast-track inline execution (no subagent spawn)"
```

**Test execution** (Step 4): Record test runner events with `--phase execution --stage TEST_EXECUTION`.

When `run-execution-batch-plan` reports no pending segments, advance through ctl:

```bash
"$DYNOS" ctl run-execution-finish .dynos/task-{id}
```

This command refuses the transition if any segment is still pending, AND it runs the full evidence verification (non-empty `evidence/{seg-id}.md` per segment, every `files_expected` entry on disk) inside the stage gate before advancing to `TEST_EXECUTION`. If it reports `"status": "blocked"` with `failures`, address each listed failure and re-run. Do not manually decide that execution is complete.

### Step 4 — Run tests

Read `plan.md` Test Strategy. Run the specified tests. Use incremental testing if the framework supports it (e.g. `jest --onlyChanged`).

If an approved TDD suite exists, run those tests first as the blocking contract suite. If they pass, run any broader regression suite required by `plan.md`.

If tests pass:
- Append to log: `{timestamp} [DONE] tests — passed`
- Continue to Audit

If tests fail:
- Append to log: `{timestamp} [FAIL] tests — failed. Repairs required.`
- Update `manifest.json` stage to `REPAIR_PLANNING` (legal per `ALLOWED_STAGE_TRANSITIONS["TEST_EXECUTION"]`; the older single `REPAIR` stage no longer exists)
- Hand off to `/dynos-work:audit` — its Step 4 owns the two-phase repair loop. There is no standalone `repair` skill.

### Step 5 — Verify completion

After successfully completing execution and tests (and any repairs triggered by tests or audit), re-run the deterministic evidence verifier as confirmation:

```bash
"$DYNOS" ctl run-execution-verify-evidence .dynos/task-{id}
```

This command checks every non-cached segment's evidence file exists and is non-empty, and that every `files_expected` entry exists on disk. It is legal at both `EXECUTION` and `TEST_EXECUTION` (the same verification already ran inside the `run-execution-finish` stage gate in Step 3 — this re-run confirms nothing regressed during test execution). It exits non-zero with a JSON error payload if any check fails. **Do NOT assert completion in prompt logic — consume this command's output as the authoritative pass/fail signal.**

If the command reports `"status": "blocked"`, address each listed failure before proceeding.

Append to log:
```
{timestamp} [DONE] execute — all segments verified by ctl (segments_verified={N})
```

### Handoff — Write handoff record

After Step 5, run:

```text
"$DYNOS" ctl write-execute-handoff .dynos/task-{id}
```

This writes `.dynos/task-{id}/handoff-execute-audit.json` deterministically from the live manifest stage. Do NOT hand-write the handoff JSON in prompt logic.

## Hard Rules
- **No speculative implementation:** Executors must stay strictly within their segment's `files_expected` and `criteria_ids`.
- **Atomic evidence:** Evidence files must be written only after the segment's implementation is complete.
- **Dependency discipline:** Never spawn an executor before its dependency evidence files are available.
- **Caching Discipline:** Never skip a segment if its `files_expected` have any uncommitted changes not reflected in the existing evidence.
- **Ownership discipline:** A segment that edits files outside `files_expected` is invalid until repaired and re-evidenced.
