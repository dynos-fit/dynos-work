# dynos-work: Plan

Re-runs the planning phase on an existing task. Use this when:
- You need to regenerate the plan after manual spec changes
- The task was initialized externally and skipped planning
- You want to replan after a major scope change

When done, the task is ready for `/dynos-work:execute`.

## Ruthlessness Standard

- Treat a vague plan as a delayed execution failure.
- Do not accept coverage by implication. Every acceptance criterion needs an explicit owner and mechanism.
- If the plan does not name failure modes, rollback impact, and verification strategy, it is incomplete.

## What you do

### Step 1 — Find active task

Find the most recent active task in `.dynos/` (manifest.json with stage not DONE/FAILED). If none, print "No active task. Start one with /dynos-work:start" and stop.

Read `manifest.json`, `spec.md`, and `design-decisions.md` (if it exists).

Verify `spec.md` exists. If not, print "No spec found. Run /dynos-work:start to generate one." and stop.

### Step 2 — Generate plan (PLANNING)

Transition the stage by running:

```text
python3 hooks/ctl.py transition .dynos/task-{id} PLANNING
```

Append to execution log (transition_task already auto-logged the `[STAGE] → PLANNING` line; only emit the `[SPAWN]` line):
```
{timestamp} [SPAWN] planning — generate implementation plan
```

Spawn the `planning` agent with instruction: "Generate the implementation plan and execution graph. Read `spec.md` and `design-decisions.md` (if it exists). Human design choices are binding. Write to `.dynos/task-{id}/plan.md` and `.dynos/task-{id}/execution-graph.json`. Include: technical approach, module/component breakdown, data flow, error handling, failure modes, rollback or migration risk where relevant, test strategy, and explicit file ownership per segment. Do not leave any acceptance criterion covered only by implication."

Wait for completion. Finalize planning through the deterministic control-plane entrypoint. Run:

```text
python3 hooks/ctl.py run-planning .dynos/task-{id}
```

`run-planning` owns full deterministic artifact validation, writes the `plan-validated` receipt, and advances `PLANNING -> PLAN_REVIEW` when the artifacts are sound. If it exits non-zero, the JSON payload tells you exactly why replanning is required.

Append to log (the ctl command above may already advance to `PLAN_REVIEW`; only emit the `[DONE]` line):
```
{timestamp} [DONE] planning — plan.md written
```

### Step 3 — Human review (PLAN_REVIEW)

Read `plan.md`. Present to the user using **AskUserQuestion**:

```
=== Plan Review ===

[contents of plan.md]

---
Approve this plan? (yes / no + what to change)
```

- If **approved**: run the `approve-stage` ctl command below. It hashes the current `plan.md`, writes the `human-approval-PLAN_REVIEW` receipt with that hash, then transitions PLAN_REVIEW → PLAN_AUDIT in one atomic step. The hash is computed from the CURRENT `plan.md` content **at transition time** (the `transition_task` gate re-hashes the file and compares it to `receipt.artifact_sha256`), so an approval that races against a manual edit to `plan.md` after the receipt is written will be refused with the literal substrings `human-approval-PLAN_REVIEW` and `hash mismatch`. Do NOT add a manual `[HUMAN]` log line — the receipt is the audit trail. Then proceed to Step 4.

  ```text
  python3 hooks/ctl.py approve-stage .dynos/task-{id} PLAN_REVIEW
  ```

  Exit code 0 means success; exit code 1 means the gate refused (stderr identifies the cause: missing artifact, hash drift, illegal transition). Do not bypass with `transition --force`.
- If **changes requested**: append `{timestamp} [HUMAN] PLAN_REVIEW — changes requested: {summary}` to log. Spawn planning agent again with the feedback. Re-present the updated plan. Repeat until approved. Do NOT call `approve-stage` against a stale plan — the next time you call it, the live `plan.md` content (and therefore its hash) MUST match the version the user just approved, otherwise the transition will be refused.
- If **rejected**: set `manifest.json` stage to `FAILED`, append `[FAILED] Plan rejected by user`. Stop.

### Step 4 — Spec coverage audit (PLAN_AUDIT)

The `approve-stage` call in Step 3 has already advanced the manifest to `PLAN_AUDIT` and auto-logged the `[STAGE] → PLAN_AUDIT` transition line — do NOT call `transition .dynos/task-{id} PLAN_AUDIT` here (the state machine would refuse it as `PLAN_AUDIT → PLAN_AUDIT`).

Run the deterministic plan-audit controller first:

```text
python3 hooks/ctl.py run-plan-audit .dynos/task-{id}
```

Interpret the JSON result:

- `status == "replan_required"`: deterministic gap analysis found fake or weak claims. Replan before any LLM audit.
- `status == "passed"` with `mode == "deterministic_only"`: low/medium-risk task. No LLM plan-audit is needed.
- `status == "llm_audit_required"`: high/critical-risk task. Spawn `spec-completion-auditor`, then finalize with:

  ```text
  python3 hooks/ctl.py run-plan-audit .dynos/task-{id} --report-path .dynos/task-{id}/audit-reports/plan-audit-{timestamp}.json --tokens-used {TOTAL_TOKENS} --model {MODEL_USED}
  ```

If the final `run-plan-audit` call returns `status == "replan_required"`, repair the plan and rerun it. If it returns `status == "passed"`, proceed.

### Step 5 — Done

Transition the stage by running:

```text
python3 hooks/ctl.py transition .dynos/task-{id} PRE_EXECUTION_SNAPSHOT
```

Append to log:
```
{timestamp} [ADVANCE] PLAN_AUDIT → PRE_EXECUTION_SNAPSHOT
```

Print:
```
Plan approved and audited. All acceptance criteria covered.

Next: /dynos-work:execute
```
