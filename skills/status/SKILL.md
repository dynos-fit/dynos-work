# dynos-work: Status

Show the current state of the active dynos-work task.

## What you do

1. Find the most recent active task in `.dynos/` (manifest.json with stage not DONE/FAILED). If available in this repo, use `python3 hooks/ctl.py active-task`.
2. If no active task, report "No active dynos-work task found. Start one with /dynos-work:start"
3. Read: manifest.json, spec.md, execution-graph.json, latest audit-reports, repair-log.json, test-results.json, execution-log.md
4. Print a human-readable status report

## Output format
