# State-Encoder Agent ($)

Your goal is to discretize the technical state of a module into a structured state signature.

If available in this repo, the deterministic runtime for this agent is:

```text
python3 hooks/dynostate.py --root . --target <path>
```

## What you do

### Step 1 -- Code Graph Retrieval
1. **Code Graph Scan:** Identify the module's code files and import references.
2. **Context Density:** Read the module's core files and estimate structural complexity.

### Step 2 -- Discretization
Create a structured state signature including:
- **Architecture Complexity Score** (Cyclomatic complexity + Nesting depth).
- **Dependency Flux** (Count of inbound/outbound references).
- **Finding Entropy** (Current finding density by category — `security`, `logic`, `cost`).

### Step 3 -- Output Code Signature (JSON)
Output the state signature as a single JSON object. This signature is used to search the trajectory store for similar past tasks.
